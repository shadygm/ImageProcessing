# ImageProcessing
Image Processing assignments get a grasp of it.

## Assignment 1
1. Implement all intensity transformation from Figure 3.3 (Identity, Negative, Log, nth root, nth power, inverse log). Use either gray-level transform of the attached image, or choose an image at your discretion (preferably to show the effect of each filter).
2. Implement color piecewise linear transformation function that given proper ranges ((A,B) for each channel from Figure 3.11), can detect vegetables with a certain color range (or the background) from the attached image (peppers.png). 

## Assignment 2
1. Implement histogram equalization (Figure 3.20) and apply it on the images attached.
2. (Figure 3.32) Design a band-stop filter using DCT transform code provided and apply it to different images (including but not limited to the images attached). Inverse-transform your band-stop filter and analyze the filter in the spatial domain.

## Assignment 3
1. Using low-pass spatial filters and/or intensity transformation, detect sources (i.e. stars, galaxies and so) and generate an out image where pixels on the sources are white and the others black.
2. Remove salt and pepper noise by using median filter.
3. Apply image sharpening using a laplacian filter.

## Assignment 4
1. Implement dilation and erosion filter for binary images using user-defined structuring elements.
